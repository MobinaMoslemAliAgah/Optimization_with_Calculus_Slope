Optimization Calculus: Slope Analysis
This project focuses on the application of optimization calculus to analyze and determine optimal solutions in various financial scenarios. Specifically, it explores the concept of the slope in relation to optimization problems, providing insights into how changes in variables affect the overall outcome of a given function.

Overview
Optimization calculus is a powerful mathematical tool used to find the maximum or minimum values of functions, which is essential in fields like finance for portfolio optimization, cost minimization, and resource allocation. By examining the slope of functions, this project aims to identify optimal points and understand the sensitivity of outcomes to changes in key parameters.
